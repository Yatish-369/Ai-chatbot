🛠️ Python Chatbot using Together AI API
Welcome to the Python Chatbot Project!
This chatbot connects to the Together AI API and uses the Mistral-7B-Instruct model to generate intelligent, human-like responses to user inputs.

🚀 Forward-thinking, simple, and powerful!

📚 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how you can integrate an external LLM (Large Language Model) API into a Python application to build an interactive chatbot.
It uses:

Python requests to interact with the API.

Together AI's API for chatting with a powerful open-source LLM (mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2).

✨ Features
Send a message to the bot and get dynamic, intelligent replies.

Easy to customize model parameters like temperature and max tokens.

Lightweight and beginner-friendly code structure.

Extendable for more advanced features like multi-turn conversations, saving chats, or GUI integration!

🛠️ How It Works
Set your Together AI API Key.

Send user messages to the https://api.together.ai/v1/chat/completions endpoint.

Receive model-generated responses.

Display the responses in the terminal.
